AggPasMod
---------
Based on AggPas, which is itself based on the Anti-Grain Geometry, this project offers support for the latest Delphi Versions (XE and above) and contains some helper classes (VCL components and FireMonkey interface).

Initially, the AggPas port had been modernized only to see how it compares performance wise. However, after many weeks of work and several improvments (assembler optimizations, better code readability, some helper classes), it was decided to release this modernized version of the AggPas port independently.

The project was hosted on SourceForge and has been moved to GitHub. 


Installation
------------
Once the project has been checked out or downloaded, it can be installed in the IDE by installing the runtime and the design-time packages for the given Delphi/Lazarus version. However, before that some directories must be known by the IDE. Please specify these manually until the packages compile. 

Alternatively the packages can be obtained and installed via GetIt (XE8). 

Recently Delphinus-Support has also been added to support older Delphi versions (see https://github.com/Memnarch/Delphinus for more information).
